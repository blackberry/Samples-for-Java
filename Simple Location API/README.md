# Simple Location API

Simple Location API, as the name suggests, is a simplified version of the Location API packages available on the BlackBerry&reg; development platform. This API is built on top of the existing Location APIs and offers a simple, worry-free but feature-rich API that will hopefully allow the developers to focus on their application instead of spending a lot of time on the complex details and corner cases of standard Location APIs. A demo application is included with the source.

The project can be imported with the BlackBerry Java Plugin for Eclipse. Once it has been imported, build it and run to test it on a simulator or device.

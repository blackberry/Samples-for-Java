# YouTube Client Sample

This sample application was featured on our developer blog and included in the Knowledgebase. It shows how to use the Communication API in BlackBerry SDK 6.0 with the YouTube Data API to search for videos, read the XML data feed and extract data from it.

The project can be imported with the BlackBerry Java Plugin for Eclipse. Once it has been imported, build it and run to test it on a simulator or device.

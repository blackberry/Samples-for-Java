# NFCTransactionHandler Sample


The purpose of this application is to demonstrate key aspects of an application working in NFC card emulation mode. It is accompanied by article "NFC Card Emulation Primer" which can be found in the BlackBerry developer resource centre and is linked off the following index page:

http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Java-Development/NFC-Article-Index/ta-p/1538775

The application is liberally instrumented with EventLogger Informational messages using the label "NfcTransactionHandler" that can be examined in the event log of a device. Use Alt-LGLG to set the log level to Information and to examine the event log or use javaloader -u eventlog>eventlog.txt to extract the log to your PC over USB.
